                My name is Daniel Ferreira. My family moved to the US from Brazil in 1997, and on April 23, 1999, I was
                born in Urbana, Illinios. Shortly after, my family moved to Roswell, GA, north of Atlanta, where we
                have lived up to the present day. I have two older brothers, both of which have moved out and married. The oldest lives in Manhattan and works for a high frequency algorithmic trading company,
                and the other works for AT&T in Cumming, GA. My father works for Turner Broadcasting in downtown
                Atlanta.

                I grew up in suburban Roswell, GA. My childhood hobbies consisted of videogames, piano, and more
                videogames. Up until the winter of 2018, videogames dominated the majority of my time investment. I'm
                extremely competitve and passionate, and for most of life, all of that passion was, for the most part,
                channeled into videogames. It was the most conveneient and pleasureable escape from life's problems
                that I had access to, and I abused it extensively, at the expense of all of my
                responsibilities. Meanwhile, my oldest brother, whom I looked up to, had graduated from highschool as
                valedictorian, and 4 years later had graduated from Princeton University. Growing up I'd always been
                "smart" and "bright," ahead of my peers in math and talented in music, so I had similar
                expectations for myself.

            <p>
                I never met those academic expectations. I failed many classes, and skipped an ungoldy number of school days. I didn't have the self-control, and I didn't the
                self-discipline. I definetely had the motiviation, but that motivation didn't drive me to work, it
                drove me to run from the work and my overwhelming fear of failure, while I built up habits of procrastination, anxiety,
                depression, and suicidal thoughts. I hated myself for what I was doing to myself and my loving parents.
                In the end I could never blame them; the cycle always led me to a place where, with intense self-loathing, I
                completely blamed myself. Videogames were a convenient escape, possesing endless entertainment and being seemingly void of consequences. It
                was a place that provided a counterfeit source of value, fulfillment, and acceptance, where my ability to achieve
                success, growth, and mastery, among friends, seemed to flourish. It was the fruit of a larger void that plagued my
                soul, something deeper dealing with my own self-worth, worldview, and expectations for myself. Of course, it was accompanied
                by many other addictions and habits as well, such as binge-watching Netflix and anime, surfing Youtube and reddit, and binge-eating. it was all the same thing.
                A substitue for reality.

                I thank the Lord Jesus Christ continually for bringing me out of that hole and giving me life. Everything
                began turning around in the spring semester of my senior year, 2018. That semester I made up 5 credits, got straight A's,
                took 5 AP exams, scoring three 5's and two 4's, and successfully graduated on my fourth year. I have yet to quite
                understand with certainty how it happened; I couldn't explain to you what that semester was like if I tried, but one thing I know:
                I never suffered from anxiety, depression, or thoughts of suicide ever again. I believe a major part of my success that semester
                was because Jesus had set me free from those things.

                The summer following my highschool graduation, the now-infamous Fortnite had just started gaining some popularity
                (I played it before it was cool -- well, when it was less cool), and I was into it. I continued wasting
                all my time and living completely irresponsibly. However, that didn't last long.
                In December of 2018, my entire life was completely transformed. I haven't touched an xbox controller or ps4 controller since then. Netflix,
                anime, reddit, Youtube; entertainment is no longer a part of my life. Since then, I have deleted the majority of my social media accounts, and my life has never been better. I no longer
                regularly ingest entertainment in any form, completely cutting it out of my lifestyle, and it's literally amazing.

                That winter, I experienced the living Christ. I got sick and tired of trying to be good enough on my own, of suffering under
                the weight of my flaws and my sin. I had grown up in church, and I believed in Jesus, but I had never experienced anything real.
                I got on my knees and I cried out to God; I told him I was blind and lost, and I admitted that I was full of ignorance
                of who He really is. I admitted to Him that I was broken and confused, and I put my trust in Him to save me, teach me
                His truth, and draw me in to know Him, and I began reading the Bible everyday for hours. I started with the Gospel, the books
                about Jesus, His life, and everything He said and did. Immediately God began to transform my mind and my life. Addictions and
                insecurities were broken off my life. I began an upward spiral that has never stopped. He started revealing to me things about
                myself and about Him. He revealed to me the things in my heart that were taking His place, and so I cast aside all my past
                passions and lusts and pursued Him. I deleted my xbox account, packed up all of my games and game consoles to give them
                all away, and I cut off entertainment, not out of obligation, but out of the revelation of the worthlessness of it all and
                of the endless worth of knowing Jesus Christ. The person I used to be a year ago is completely unrecognizable. Even a month ago,
                I was a different person. I continue growing in wisdom, love, discipline, and the knowledge of God, and He continues to mold me
                into the person He created me to be and leading me in a life full of purpose and fulfillment. I am forever grateful, and
                I will never be able to repay Him for the priceless worth of the blood of Jesus which was shed for me. He bore my sin and shame
                so that I could be reconciled with the Creator of my soul, the one who breathed life into me and knit me together in my mother's
                womb, who purposed in His heart to love me since the very foundation of the world.
